# Repository for "Practical Case Studies of ExplainableAI(XAi)/ML(XMl)"
#In this repo, we will explore and discuss some basic concepts machine learning & deep learning models and strategies to interpret models and their features; as AI/ML models are often black box

#Using ExplainableAI (XAi)/ML(XMl), we will be able to interpret, validate, understand the models more transparent in fashion rather than simple prediction. 

#In this repo, we have captured some case studies of AI/ML models with XAi/XMl using respective packages.
